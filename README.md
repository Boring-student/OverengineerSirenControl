Overengineer Siren Control (OSC) is a customizable AutoHotkey V.1 script controling siren for Roblox game.

Trust me when I said overengineer I really meant it.
Nobody have this problem where your spaghetti fingers decide to tangle and blocked each other when you changing siren except me but I guess it's cool to have?
